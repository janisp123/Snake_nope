# Minimal Cube Collector ðŸŽ®

A bare-bones browser game made with plain JavaScript and Canvas.

## How to Play
- Open **`index.html`** in any modern browser.
- Use **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to move the yellow square.
- Collect the blue squares.  
- Each time you collect one, your **score** increases and another block spawns.

## Features
- No libraries, no build step â€” just vanilla JS + Canvas.
- Player cube moves smoothly with keyboard input.
- Target block respawns at random locations (avoids overlapping with player).
- Score counter shown in the top-left corner.

## Files
- `index.html` â€” sets up the canvas and loads the game.
- `game.js` â€” all game logic (movement, collision, scoring, rendering).
- `README.md` â€” this file.

## Requirements
- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- Keyboard input enabled (WASD or Arrow keys).
